# Repository Guidelines (migrated)

Instructions now live in `agents.json` to match the latest JSON-based agent format. Treat that file as the source of truth. If your tooling still reads `AGENTS.md`, point it at `agents.json` via your Codex config (e.g., add `agents.json` to `project_doc_fallback_filenames`) or mirror updates from the JSON file.
